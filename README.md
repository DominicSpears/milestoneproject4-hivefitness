#### Future Features

* I currently only have one administrator and any restricted areas are accessed via username matching.
I would like to introduce multiple administrators via a dedicated is_admin field. I currently have added an 
is_admin field to the user database but due to time constraints have not written the code to use it as the 
key to access restricted pages. 

* I would like to add a filter system to select recipes based on other features. For example dietary 
requirements or cook times.

* I would like to add a review system so that users can review other peoples recipes and rate them.
